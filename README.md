This project involved mating together the front end and back end to make a complete page. 

The user is first taken to a landing page where they can choose to take a survey. They are then sent to a survey page where they are asked to input their name and a link to an image of themselves. After those two inputs they can take a survey of 10 questions. After the survey is completed and submitted they will be paired up with a friend from the database that most closely matches their answers.
